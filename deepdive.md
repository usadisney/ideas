# Deep Dive into the Splunk Log Collector

## Overview

The **Splunk Log Collector** is a robust, scalable, and extensible Python-based solution designed to aggregate identity logs from multiple sources such as Ping, MyID, and Okta using Splunk's REST API. Its primary goal is to unify logs from various identity sources into a centralized system for near real-time analysis and monitoring. This enables organizations, especially large enterprises, to effectively monitor authentication events, access patterns, and potential security incidents across their infrastructure.

The system is architected to handle large volumes of data efficiently, ensuring scalability and reliability suitable for a Fortune 10 company. It leverages AWS services like Lambda, Step Functions, EventBridge, and S3 to orchestrate and process data, incorporating best practices for high performance and maintainability.

## High-Level Architecture

### Components Overview

- **AWS Step Functions State Machine**: Orchestrates the workflow, managing the sequence and execution of tasks.
- **AWS Lambda Functions**: Perform specific tasks such as initiating Splunk jobs, polling for job completion, processing results, and interacting with AWS services.
- **Splunk REST API**: Interface for executing searches and retrieving results from Splunk.
- **AWS EventBridge**: Event bus for routing processed log events to downstream consumers.
- **AWS S3 Buckets**: Stores raw logs for archival and further batch processing.
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Securely stores credentials required to access Splunk instances.
- **AWS Lambda Powertools**: Enhances Lambda functions with utilities for structured logging, metrics, and tracing.
- **Configuration and Parser Modules**: Use composition over inheritance to manage identity sources, allowing easy addition of new sources.

### Workflow Summary

1. **Initiation**: The process starts via a scheduled trigger or manually, initiating the AWS Step Functions state machine.
2. **Splunk Job Initiation**: A Lambda function starts a Splunk search job using the provided query and configuration for the identity source.
3. **Job Polling**: The system employs an adaptive polling mechanism with exponential backoff to efficiently check the job status.
4. **Result Processing**: Upon job completion, a Lambda function retrieves results in manageable chunks, processes the logs using source-specific parsers, and prepares them for downstream consumption.
5. **Data Forwarding**: Processed logs are sent to AWS EventBridge, and raw logs are stored in AWS S3, both optimized for high throughput.
6. **Cleanup**: The Splunk job is canceled to release resources.
7. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing are implemented for monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Detailed Component Breakdown

### 1. AWS Step Functions State Machine

**Purpose**: Orchestrates the sequence of Lambda functions, managing retries, error handling, and the overall workflow.

**Workflow Steps**:

- **Start Execution**: Triggered by an AWS CloudWatch Events schedule or manually.
- **Initiate Splunk Job**: Invokes the `InitiateSplunkJob` Lambda function to start a search job.
- **Wait State with Exponential Backoff**: Waits before polling, increasing the interval between polls to reduce API calls.
- **Poll Job Status**: Invokes the `PollJobStatus` Lambda function to check if the Splunk job has completed.
- **Branching Logic**:
  - If the job is not ready, the state machine loops back to the wait state.
  - If the job is ready, it proceeds to process results.
- **Process Results**: Invokes the `ProcessResults` Lambda function to fetch and process the results.
- **Parallel Tasks**:
  - **Send to EventBridge**: Sends processed events for downstream consumption.
  - **Store in S3**: Saves raw logs for archival purposes.
- **Cleanup**: Invokes the `Cleanup` Lambda function to cancel the Splunk job.
- **End State**: The workflow completes successfully or transitions to error handling paths if failures occur.

**State Machine Definition (Simplified)**:
